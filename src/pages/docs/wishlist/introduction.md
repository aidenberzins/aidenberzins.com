Creating technical design documents for a web application involving a React frontend, a NestJS backend, and a Python web scraping microservice involves several components. Below is an outline of the structure and contents for these documents.

### 1. **Introduction**

#### Purpose

- Briefly describe the purpose of the web application.
- Outline the main functionalities and user interactions.

#### Scope

- Define the scope of the application, including its key features and limitations.

#### Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

- Provide definitions for technical terms, acronyms, and abbreviations used in the document.

### 2. **System Overview**

#### Architecture Diagram

- Include a high-level architecture diagram showing the React frontend, NestJS backend, and Python microservice.

#### Component Overview

- Describe the role of each component:
  - **React Frontend:** User interface for submitting URLs and viewing scraped data.
  - **NestJS Backend:** Middleware for handling requests between the frontend and the Python microservice.
  - **Python Web Scraping Microservice:** Service responsible for scraping data from URLs.

### 3. **Detailed Design**

#### React Frontend

- **Technology Stack:** Describe the technologies used (e.g., React, Redux for state management, etc.).
- **User Interface:** Outline the UI components, such as forms for URL submission and areas for displaying scraped data.
- **Data Flow:** Explain how data is handled and passed between components.

#### NestJS Backend

- **Technology Stack:** Mention the use of NestJS, TypeScript, etc.
- **API Endpoints:** Document the API endpoints, including paths, request/response formats, and HTTP methods.
- **Error Handling:** Describe how errors are managed and communicated back to the frontend.

#### Python Web Scraping Microservice

- **Technology Stack:** Outline the use of Python, Flask or FastAPI, and scraping libraries.
- **API Endpoint:** Detail the endpoint for receiving scraping requests.
- **Scraping Logic:** Describe the scraping algorithm, including how the HTML is parsed and data is extracted.

### 4. **Data Model**

- Provide the data schema used in the application, including data structures passed between frontend, backend, and microservice.

### 5. **Security and Privacy Considerations**

- Discuss authentication (if any).
- Outline measures to protect sensitive data.
- Address any legal considerations related to web scraping.

### 6. **Testing Strategy**

- Describe the testing methodologies (unit tests, integration tests, etc.).
- Detail the tools and frameworks used for testing each component.

### 7. **Deployment and Maintenance**

- Outline the deployment process for each component.
- Discuss the strategy for updating and maintaining the application.

### 8. **Conclusion**

- Summarize the key points of the document.
- Highlight any potential areas for future development or improvement.

### Appendices

- Include any additional information, such as detailed API documentation, that supports the main content of the document.
